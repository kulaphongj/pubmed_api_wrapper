# Yelp API Wrapper

Keep in mind we have to use branches to push. My process has been:

1. Make changes  
2. git checkout -b CraigBranch  
3. git add ., git commit -m "added stuff"  
4. git push --set-upstream origin CraigBranch  
5. git checkout main  
6. Confirm/create pull request & merge on repo gui  
7. Delete branch directly from repo GUI side after  
8. git pull     from main  
9. git delete -d CraigBranch     to delete remote OR  
10. git delete -D CraigBranch     if didn't delete from GUI
