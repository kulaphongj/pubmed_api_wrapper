\title{Yelp Business Data Retrieval Functions}
\description{
The `search_functions.R` script contains functions to query and retrieve business information from the Yelp Fusion API. Functions include `search_businesses` for fetching data based on specific search criteria and potentially other functions for additional data retrieval and processing tasks.
}

\usage{
search_businesses(api_key, location, business_type, keyword, offset = 0, limit = 50)
# Add other function usages here as necessary
}

\details{
`search_businesses` queries the Yelp Fusion API for businesses matching the specified criteria. It returns a list of businesses if the query is successful or NULL in case of an error or if no businesses are found matching the criteria.
